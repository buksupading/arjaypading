        <h2>Beyond my pursuits,</h2>
        <p>
            Beyond my academic pursuits, I am dedicating my time to serving the community as a SK Kagawad in my barangay. I enjoy taking the reins on something that can always help my home, along with empowering a sense of belonging. I am also an active member of the youth ministry of my church as the Vice President. Within these experiences, I have gained leadership, teamwork, and service aspects to better prepare me for serving others.
